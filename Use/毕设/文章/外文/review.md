# OVERALL

突然意识到这篇文章可以作为第二段的内容！

## 二

* A讲了卷积操作
* B讲了RV扩展：压缩指令，位操作，原子操作

## 三

* ***A：压缩数据精度，可以到时候用，但是现在来不及看了**The alternative to using binary ...... in this section have proposed*
* C：
  * 27也是和压缩有关 28是内核重排和使用单独FIFO和加速器  小参考价值,不引入开题报告
  * ***19和29讲稀疏性(检测0)，格外关注下，但是不引到开题报告里***
  * 最后两段可以无视
* ***E：最后这段里可以摘抄一些SIMD的描述***
* ***The processing mode is another component of energy
  consumption. Parallel processing is a robust implementation to
  distribute tasks between different processing elements, either
  cores or PEs. Its execution response is faster than single-
  instruction processing, which improves throughput. Almost all
  the implementations apply parallel processing one way or
  another. The RISC-V factor is evident in the custom extension
  for SIMD to manage parallel instructions, e. g. [15], [34], [29].
  [35] introduces parallel processing for two RISC-V processors,
  one in a simplified setting for general purpose activity, and the
  second a more capable processor for the CNN execution.
  Finally, the IMC projects involve implicitly parallel processing
  since all the NVM cells act at the same time and provide results
  in a few cycles.***
